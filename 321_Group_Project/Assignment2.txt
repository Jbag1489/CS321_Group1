A datatype is a set of data with unique characteristics.
There are several common datatypes in Java.
 
The most commonly used datatypes are:
 
Integer -   Integer vaues are whole numbers. In Java, integers can be negative or positive between
            the range -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647.
           
            Integere values are declared in Java by using the keyword "int" followed by the name
            of the integer.
           
Double  -   Double values are decimal numbers, but also include whole numbers. They are useful for
            finding precise calculations.
           
            Double values are declared in Java by using the keyword "double" followed by the name
            of the double value.
           
String  -   String values are "strings" of characters. They can be sentences or just one letter.
            An example of a String would be "The sky is blue".
           
            Strings are declared in Java by using the keyword "String" (the 'S' MUST be uppcase)
            followed the name of the String.
           
This assignment will explain the different datatypes and how they are used.
