In many programming languages, it is customary to first create a Hello World program.
In Java, the command to print to the console is print("String you wish to print."). 
If you want you want to print and then follow  with a new line, you would use println("String to print.").

The print function is in the java System.out class. 

A full command to print Hello World would be:
	System.out.println("Hello World");
	
Notice that the command ended with a semicolon. 
The semicolon is a directive to the compiler that that is the end of the command.

There are two ways to put a comment in Java, the first way is two forward slashes (//).
	This will create a comment to the end of the line.
The second way to create a comment is a forward slash and then an asterisk (/*).
	This will create a comment until a asterisk and a forward slash (*/).

	System.out.println("Kirk cheated!");
	
	// I guess we should say Hello World, just for tradition.
	System.out.println("Hello World!");
