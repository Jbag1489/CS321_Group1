You can perform math operations on variables in Java.

Some simple operations in Java are:

Addition (+)       -   Adds two values together.

Subtraction (-)    -   Subtracts one value from another.

Multiplication (*) -   Multiplies two values together.

Division (/)       -   Divides one value into another.
			
This assignment will demonstrate how to use the 4 simple operations.

		double decimal2 = 2.45;
		
		/* Define variables to hold results of operations */
		int sum;		// Will hold the result of an addition (+) operation
		double difference;	// Will hold the result of a suctraction (-) operation
		int product;	// Will hold the result of a multiplication (*) operation
		int quotient;	// Will hold the result of a division (/) operation
		
		/* Perform the 4 operations and store the result in the variables above */
		sum = number1 + number2;			// Add 16 and 8 and store in variable sum     
		difference = decimal1 - decimal2;	// Subtract 9.94 from 2.45 and store in variable difference
		product = decimal1 * decimal2;		// Multiply 9.94 and 2.45 and store in variable product
		quotient = number1 / number2;		// Divide 8 into 16 and store in variable quotient
		
		/* Print the variables to show that the operations worked correctly */
		System.out.println("Sum of number1 and number2: " + sum);						// Prints "24"
		System.out.println("Difference between decimal1 and decimal2: " + difference); 	// Prints "-7.49"
		System.out.println("Product of decimal1 and decimal2: " + product);				// Prints "24.353"
		System.out.println("Quotient of number2 into number1: " + quotient);			// Prints "2"
