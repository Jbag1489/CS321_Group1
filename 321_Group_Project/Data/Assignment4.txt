There is a structure in Java programming known as an "if statement".

If statements are used to determine if certain blocks of code should be executed.

If statements are strucutred like so:
if (condition IS TRUE)
{
	// Code to be executed is written here
}

public class IfStatementDemonstration {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		/* Define some simple variables */
		int x = 8;
		int y = 2;
		int z = 6;
		
		/* Construct simple if statements to demonstrate how they work */
		if (x + y == 10) {
			System.out.println("8 + 2 = 10!"); // Prints "8 + 2 = 10!" if the condition "x + y == 10" is true
		}
		
		if (x == 4) {
			System.out.println("8 is equal to 4"); // Prints "8 is equal to 4" if the condition "x == 4" is true
		}
